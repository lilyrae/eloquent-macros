## Eloquent Macros
This project demonstrates the use of Eloquent Relation Macros, a handy tool to extend the functionality of eloquent. The project shows a macro which converts a has-many relationship to a has-one (found inside a MacroServiceProvider). There is any accompanying test (UserTest) to show it working.

I explain laravel macros further in my blog post:
